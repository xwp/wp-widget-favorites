Store revisions of widget instances for re-use.

== Description ==

Sometimes you may have a certain widget configuration that you need to use over-and-over again.
It would be great of there was a way to store these widget configurations in an a way
that they could be recalled and used as templates for creating new similar widgets.
This is what the Widget Favorites plugin does. It provides a way to save widget any
widget instance and to give it a particular name to identify it later when loading
the favorited widget instance into another widget.

Another way to look at this plugin is that it provides (non-automatic) revisions for widgets.

Note that this only adds functionality to widgets managed in the Customizer.
